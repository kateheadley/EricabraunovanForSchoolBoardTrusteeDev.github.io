Erica Braunovan is a mother of two children that will be attending public school in the fall. With an extensive background in social work and counselling, Erica has the knowledge, skills and experience to help our communities’ schools meet your child’s education needs. 

<h2>IN HER OWN WORDS</h2>

<h3>Fair play</h3>

Education is a fundamental right in Canada. I recognize more work must be done to secure fair and equitable access to quality education for all students, including those in special education programs.

<h3>Group work</h3>

Ottawa’s communities are wonderfully diverse. I will work to ensure that our schools play a key role in nurturing more inclusive communities. Together, we can make our schools the hubs of our neighbourhoods again.

<h3>Language arts</h3>

Open dialogue between educators and parents will enhance a child’s learning and development. I will maintain good lines of communication so the focus can always be where it needs to be — students.

<h3>Show your work</h3>

Everyone has a role to play in building successful futures for children — governments, administrators, educators, families, and — sorry, kids — students. As a link for you to all these players, I will establish common objectives so that we’re working together to achieve the same successes.
